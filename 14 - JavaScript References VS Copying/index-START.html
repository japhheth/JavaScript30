    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

  

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    //let team1 = players;

  

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    //team1[3] = "Jay";

    // however what happens when we update that array?
   // console.log('Original array changed',players);
   // console.log("A normal copy of the person array",team1);

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    let team2 = players.slice();
    
    team2[3] = "japheth";
    console.log('Original array unchanged',players); 
    console.log("slice method",team2);

    team3[3] = "Onyenuwe";
    console.log('Original array unchanged',players);
    console.log('concat method',team3)
    

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team4[3] = "OJ";
    console.log('Original array unchanged',players);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const cap2 = person;
    // console.log(cap2);
    // cap2.age = 100;
    // console.log(cap2)
    // console.log(person)

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {age : 70, gender : 'Male'});
    console.log("Object copied from Person Object",cap2);
    console.log("Original Object", person)

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};
    cap3.age = 60;
    console.log("3rd cap", cap3);
    console.log("Original Object", person)
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
